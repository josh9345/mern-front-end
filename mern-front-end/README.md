# Mern-front-end recipe website!

this application was built to allow users to search for recipes by key ingredient or dish type. this project was built from the ground up including database, api and front end using the MERN stack. once on the website you can select which search criteria you wish to use then click submit or hit enter this will load all the results at the bottom of the page.

## Bugs and known issues

1. after switching from netlify to surge the button style has gone away, the buttons still work.
2. after searching for a specific item you must scroll down as for right now the results are loaded at the bottom of the page
3. There is one item that has every ingredient so it shows up on every search.
